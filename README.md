# 42 Piscine
👋 Hello there! Welcome to my 42 piscine repository! 🚀

This repository contains all the projects I completed during the intensive four-week coding bootcamp at 42 school. During the piscine, I was challenged to learn and complete projects in a variety of programming languages, including C and shell.

### 🔍 Some of the projects in this repository include:
- Rushes: a series of group projects where we had to create a program from scratch within a limited time frame, often with a specific theme or goal in mind. 🏎️
- Shell: a project where we had to create our own shell from scratch, with features like job control, signal handling, and input/output redirection. 🐚

### 🧠 What I learned:
These projects were challenging, but they taught me a lot about programming and problem-solving. I learned how to work effectively in a team, how to manage my time and priorities, and how to write clean, efficient code. 💻

Thanks for stopping by and checking out my work! 🙌
